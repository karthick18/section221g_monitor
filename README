This is a US VISA Section 221G case status monitor for Chennai consulate at:
http://chennai.usconsulate.gov/221g-administrative-processing.html

It tracks the current case status against the last case status. 
It then mails the status of the changed cases. 
An example case status mail body can be seen in the case_status file.

Its expected to be run as a cronjob preferably at 5:15 PM on all weekdays as case status changes are uploaded to the Chennai US consulate website for 221G at 5 PM everyday.

It needs only 1 last case status pdf file to run/kickstart.  
For my case, this is the section_221g_cur_case_status.pdf pertaining to June 25th 2012.
This file is renamed to the last case status before the new case status is automatically fetched everyday.
The script then marks the case status changes before mailing the case status changes against the last one.

The tracked_case_list global in parse_221g.py also dumps additional information pertaining to only specifically tracked cases that the user might be interested in.
