This is a US VISA Section 221G case status monitor for Chennai consulate at:
http://chennai.usconsulate.gov/221g-administrative-processing.html

It tracks the current case status against the last case status. 
It then mails the status of the changed cases. 
An example case status mail body can be seen in the case_status file.

Its expected to be run as a cronjob preferably at 5:15 PM on all weekdays as case status changes are uploaded to the Chennai US consulate website for 221G at 5 PM everyday.

It needs only 1 last case status pdf file to run/kickstart.  
For my case, this is the section_221g_cur_case_status.pdf pertaining to June 25th 2012.
This file is renamed to the last case status before the new case status is automatically fetched everyday.
The script then marks the case status changes before mailing the case status changes against the last one.

The tracked_case_list global in parse_221g.py also dumps additional information pertaining to only specifically tracked cases that the user might be interested in.

Finally the monitor dumps the date along with cases issued for the date into case_status_graph.dat. This is used to plot a graph using the plotter in case_status_graph.py using the matplotlib module.

The date vs CasesIssued graph can be viewed by checking out the case_status_graph.pdf file thats generated/updated automatically through the cronjob every weekday from the case_status_graph.dat input file used for plotting.

In case you want to plot it manually, you have to install matplotlib python module.
matplotlib for Mint/Ubuntu can be installed with:
apt-get install python-matplotlib

Alternatively, it can be installed from sourceforge: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net
